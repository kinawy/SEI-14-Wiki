Hey, guys! Here's a list of useful tips and resources for unit 1

# Git Steps:
1. **Fork**: Click on the fork button on the top right. It means to make a copy of the repository (the one being forked) into your account (the account from which you're forking).
2. **Clone**: In your terminal `git clone <repository url from your account>`. It will download the repository files into your device.
3. **Add**: `git add <file name or use . to include all files in the folder>`. It will add the specified file to the commit snapshot (if you used . it will add all the files you've made changes to in the folder).
   * **Git Status**: Make sure to use `git status` to show you what's happening and make sure of what files you added before you commit
4. **Commit**: `git commit -m "commit message"` Will save the files you've added.
5. **Branch**: 
    * **New Branch**: `git branch <branch name>` Creates a new branch.
    * **List of branches**: `git branch` Shows you a list of all your branches  
    * **Switch to a branch**: `git checkout <branch name to switch to>` Will switch to the branch specified.
    * **Create and Switch to a New Branch**: `git checkout -b <branch name will be created and switch to>` Will create a branch and switch to it.

6. **Push**: `git push origin <branch name you want to push>` Will upload the changes you've **committed** to your origin (Github repository).
